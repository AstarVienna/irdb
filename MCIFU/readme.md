# Multi-core Integral field unit

## Eckdaten

73 fibres attached to hexagonal lenslets stacked together to form a ring.
The idea is to have a lenslet every 1.5 lam/D (at 1.3um) to capture the spectrum of different portions of the PSF
Used with XAO instruments
Wavelength range: 1-1.6um
System throughput: 0.5%
Resolution ~ 3000
Detector 2048x2048
* currently uses 480x640 chip and mosaicing it around
