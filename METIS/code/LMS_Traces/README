This directory contains a script `write_aperture_list.py`, which converts
Alistair Glasse's LMS distortion files into FITS format as required by
Scopesim. The required input files `lms_dist_poly.txt` and `lms_dist_wcal.txt`
for the nominal distortion solution are provided (gunzip before use).

The file `TRACE_LMS.fits` that is included in the METIS instrument package was
originally created using the script (2021-09-08). The second extension was
edited by hand on 2022-05-13 to reflect a change in the slice length (columns
`xi_min` and `xi_max`). The script includes that change.
