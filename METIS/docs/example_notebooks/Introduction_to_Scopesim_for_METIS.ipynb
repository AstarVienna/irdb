    "This notebook presents a basic description of the simulation procedure with scopesim and tries to give some useful hints how the behaviour of each step can be inspected and controlled. Once scopesim and the necessary instrument packages are installed, a simulation is basically a four-step process using the commands `UserCommands`, `OpticalTrain`, `observe` and `readout`. The cells in this notebook are not executable; the practical application to a variety of different source objects and instrument modes is presented in other notebooks."
