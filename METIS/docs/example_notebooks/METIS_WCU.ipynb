    "- The gaps in the connection between the black-body source and the entrance port of the integrating sphere are not yet included (model is available in Roy van Boekel's document)\n",
    "- The PSF defaults to the standard SCAO PSF included in the METIS instrument package. At the very least a PSF without atmosphere contribution should be available. Ideally the PSF should be tied to the pupil-plane mask (this also applies to sky observations).\n",
    "- The focal-plane grid mask design is preliminary. The one included here has been taken from E-SPE-UZK-MET-1015 (v2), taking the Figure 5-6 as being to scale. It appears that this is not the case, though.\n",
    "- Pupil imaging could maybe be included. This could be included as an additional focal-plane mask with the appropriate plate scale onto the detectors. There are some differences as to which optical elements are included in the optical train as compared to the normal modes, but these are presumably of secondary importance. "
