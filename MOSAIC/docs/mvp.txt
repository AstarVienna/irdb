MOSAIC MVP
==========
MOS-NIR-LR-H

What should this produce?
- A FITS file with 7 traces for a single fibre bundle
- 2 objects

Needed effects
--------------
- PSF
- LSF (gaussian, for now ...)
- Trace spread width (~3pix; To add)
- Spectral trace projection description for each of the 7 (2x) traces
- Transmission
    - fibres / microlens
    - collomator
    - dichroic
    - grating
    - camera
    - detector qe
- aperture list for (2x) 7 apertures
- atmospheric dispersion (; To add)
- all the detector noise
    - shot noise
    - dark current
    - ron
    - linearity
    - exposure summing/averaging/subtracting
- detector dimensions
