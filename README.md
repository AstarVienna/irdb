### The instrument reference database for SimCADO
 
This repository contains the data files needed by SimCADO to create a model of
any given optical train.

The data is split in the following way:

* Telescopes / Observing sites :
 
  All information pertaining to the effects generated by the telescope optics
  and information regarding the site. E.g. altitude, latitude, humidiy, etc

* Instruments
  
  All information regarding the internal working of the instrument, such as 
  optics, detectors, properties (e.g. temperature), etc 

* PSFs

  Currently PSFs are kept separately, simply due to their size
