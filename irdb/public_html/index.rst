ScopeSim is moving forward
==========================

2022-07-01: Broken ScopeSim server FTP address
----------------------------------------------

.. warning:: July 2022: The downloadable content server was retired and the data migrated to a new server.

   <PKG> vX.Y and above have been redirected to a new server URL.
   Please either upgrade to the latest version (``pip install --upgrade <PKG>``), or follow these `instructions to update the server URL <https://astarvienna.github.io/server_upgrade_instructions.html>`_ in the <PKG> config file.


Sunsetting SimCADO and SimMETIS
---------------------------------
To all those still using SimCADO or SimMETIS, we thank you for continuing to use the original versions of our simulator software.
The upgrades to the server infrastructure at the University of Vienna now mean that the functions for updating internal data files will no longer work.
We will not be releasing an upgrade to SimCADO or SimMETIS as these packages have been replaced by the new multipurpose
[ScopeSim environment](https://scopesim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
